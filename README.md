DarkRP CP AntiTK
================

This is a server-side addon that will make it so Civil Protection jobs won't be able to inflict damage on other Civil Protection, and by default will display a message in console when a CP attempts to damage another CP.

To install, download the ZIP and extract to addons folder of the server.
